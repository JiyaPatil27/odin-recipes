    <h3>Steps : </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add potatoes to a small saucepan and cover with salted water; bring to a boil over 
            high heat. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes or until fork-tender. Drain and transfer 
            potatoes to a bowl; mash until mostly smooth with a few small chunks remaining.</li>
        <li>Arrange wonton wrappers on a clean work surface; evenly spoon filling into centers of 
            wontonwrappers. Lightly wet borders of wrappers with
            water. Fold two corners together to form triangles. Press edges to seal. Coat both sides 
            of samosas with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat air fryer basket with cooking 
            spray.Working in batches if needed, arrange samosas in an even layer in the basket. 
            Cook, turning once halfway through, until samosas are golden brown and crispy, about 8 
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine yogurt, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice; garlic, salt and pepper in 
            a small food processor; process until well combined. Chill, covered, up to 5 days. </li>
        <li>Serve samosas with cilantro-yogurt sauce. Garnish with additional cilantro.</li>
