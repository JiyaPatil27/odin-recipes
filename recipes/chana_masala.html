        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Give this chana masala dish a try and don't look back. Indian food is not just curried 
            sauces. This spin on an Indian chickpea curry features a healthy mixture of chickpeas, 
            tomatoes, onion, and spices. Both carnivores and vegetarians will enjoy this meal. 
            My kids love it. Leave out the green chile if the kiddies will be eating. Serve over 
            basmati or jasmine rice and enjoy. Namaste y'all!</p>
